This production is an example of how machine learning can help an agent do more complex tasks with offline learning. The nerual network integrated in this production has already learned how to handel the test, but a brand new brain looks very different. Some interactions are not completely learned yet, for instance, the agent will sometimes softlock itself by pushing the crate into the corner of the stage. With more time (Or maybe a cornerless stage :D) the agent is sure to learn how to avoid this scenario. This brain is less than five hours old and interfaces 7 discreet actuators as well as interacting with the engines physics system, needless to say the optimal age for a nural network of this complexity is a fair bit longer.
